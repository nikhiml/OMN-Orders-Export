# OMN-Orders-Export
Exporting Order Details into the order CSV
The idea is to export all the new orders into the master Orders CSV. The steps involved are -
- Logging into the orders csv to check the last updated order
- Logging into the orders admin to find the new orders in the system
- Looping through the new orders and extracting the order related information
- Updating the master Orders CSV with the new orders information
- Creating a new CSV for the new order and mailing it to the order processing team for order creation
